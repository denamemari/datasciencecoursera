#Data Set:
This research has been conducted with group of young to middle age 30 volunteers (age 19-48 years old). They perform six activities namely: WALKING, WALKING( upstairs), WALKING(downstairs), SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING and wearing their smartphone whole the time of this experiment. More than half of volunteers were selected to act as training data and only 30% were selected to be test group. Signal for sensors were processed by noise filters and sampled in sliding windows of 2.56 second and half of them overlapped. Acceleration signals were separated by low-pass filters. 
#Process: 
Part1: Create a dataset by merging the train and the test, includes
Data has been read and in next step columns name has been created then all trainY,trainX and SubTrain has been merged together and read in test data
Column name for test data has been created 
All TestY,TestX and SubTest has been merged together and read in test data the last step was create FinalData Set by merging training and test data sets
Part 2: calculate mean and standard deviation
Part 3: activities were named based on descriptive activity (Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set). 
Part 4: named data set by descriptive activities
Part 5: FinalTidyData set has been created based on average of each variable by each activity and subject.
Data frame FinalTidyData set has been summarized, merged with descriptive activity names.
